The first step involves loading historical oil demand data into a pandas DataFrame. This data forms the foundation for trend analysis and forecasting. The notebook includes instructions on how to load and clean the data.

### Step 2: Understanding Historical Trends

In this step, the notebook guides you through analyzing historical trends in the data. You’ll create visualizations that highlight patterns such as seasonality and long-term trends, which are crucial for accurate forecasting.

### Step 3: Incorporating Externalities

This step involves integrating external factors such as seasonality, economic shocks, and special events into the demand forecasting model. By considering these externalities, the model can more accurately reflect real-world fluctuations in oil demand.

### Step 4: Applying the ARIMA Model for Forecasting

This step involves applying the ARIMA model to the cleaned data. The notebook provides a detailed explanation of the model parameters and walks you through the process of fitting the model, generating forecasts, and validating the results.

### Step 5: Visualizing Forecasts and Insights

After generating forecasts, the notebook helps you create visualizations to compare historical and forecasted demand. This step is critical for understanding the model’s predictions and identifying potential areas for adjustment.
